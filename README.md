# graph-tools-backend
A backend application built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). This application provides an backend interface for retrieving data stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, providing authentication using [auth0](https://auth0.com/) and local authentication, and interacting with graph data using [networkx](https://networkx.org/). The goal of this project is to allow users to provide specification for desired graph features, which will be generated and displayed in an interactive viewer, as well as potential to analyze the graphs. Additionally, it makes use of Jenkins and Podman to setup the CI/CD pipeline, including deployment on a Kubernetes cluster (which has been simulated in minikube). For specs on Jenkins and the Kubernetes cluster, check out my kube repo. To check out the frontend, check out my [graph-tools-frontend](https://github.com/zanielsen162/graph-tools-frontend).

**Technologies Used:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [networkx](https://networkx.org/), [auth0](https://auth0.com/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [podman](https://podman.io/), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
